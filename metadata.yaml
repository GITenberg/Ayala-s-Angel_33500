description: "Ayala's Angel is a novel written by English author Anthony Trollope,\
  \ between 25 April and 24 September 1878, although it was not published for two\
  \ years. It was written as a stand-alone novel rather than as part of a series,\
  \ though several of the minor characters appear in other novels by Trollope.\nThe\
  \ plot focuses on two orphaned sisters, Lucy and Ayala Dormer, Ayala especially,\
  \ and their trials, with first their relatives, and then of the heart, though as\
  \ in most Trollope novels, pages are given over to subplots related to the main\
  \ plot.\nDue to a lack of success in his immediately preceding novels, Trollope\
  \ had difficulty publishing Ayala's Angel. It was first published in the United\
  \ States, in the periodical Cincinnati Commercial, which, as was the usual custom\
  \ for novels at the time, released it in increments, probably of four chapters per\
  \ issue, between 6 November 1880 and 23 July 1881, for which illustrations were\
  \ drawn, which were left out of the British publication, released in May 1882.\n\
